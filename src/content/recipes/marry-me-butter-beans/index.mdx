1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and sun-dried tomatoes, cooking until shallots soften, about 3 minutes.
2. Add minced garlic and salt, stirring until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3. Pour in wine and increase heat to medium-high. Cook until wine is almost fully reduced, about 2 minutes.
4. Add spinach and cook, stirring, until starting to wilt, about 2 minutes.
5. Add rinsed beans and broth. Cook gently until heated through and spinach is fully wilted, about 2 minutes.
6. Remove from heat and stir in cream and about ⅓ cup Parmesan.
7. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan on top and garnish with fresh basil.
8. Serve with crusty bread for dipping in the sauce.
