1. Combine chicken with vegetables, chiles, and spices in a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
2. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
3. Remove chiles, blend with 2 cups of broth until smooth, then return to pot.
4. Continue cooking for 45-60 minutes until chicken is tender and easily shredded.
5. Remove chicken and shred with two forks. Strain broth and discard vegetables.
6. Dip tortillas in broth, then place in a hot skillet over low heat.
